               Sringeri, a holy, scenic, hilly place in Karnataka is where peace is palpable, tangible.  Enchanted by the sacred spot, of matchless serenity, Sri Adi Shankaracharya founded here the first and foremost of his mathas, the Sringeri Math, also known as the Sringeri Sharada Peetham. Sringeri is where time has stood still; the Sringery of legend, the Sringery of mythology, the Sringeri of history, ancient and modern, the Sringeri where the successive Shankaracharyas have performed penance and attained samadhi, the Sringeri where there has always been a living Acharya,  in the authentic tradition of Adi Shankara to bless and guide mankind.</p>

              Nestled in a picturesque spot in the plateau of the Western Ghats, surrounded by charming hills rising on all sides like galleries of a huge amphitheatre, and reflected in the crystal water of Tunga river washing its steps, is the Math of Sringeri associated with the great Saankaracharya.  The surrounding mountain ranges are known as the Rishyasringa Parvata.  The appellation is derived from the celebrated saint mentioned in the Ramayana.  A more charming spot can hardly be found in the whole of Mysore Plateau which abounds with natural scenes.</p>
